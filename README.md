This is my personal website, running on React. It's deployed using [Surge](https://surge.sh/), and uses Travis for CI/CD. When a new branch is pushed to, or a pull request is opened, an automatic test deployment is created on a subdomain. When this branch is merged into master, Travis triggers a full build and deploys to the main domain.

This site uses React-Bootstrap components for most styling.
